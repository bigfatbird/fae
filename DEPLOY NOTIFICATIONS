DEPLOY NOTIFICATIONS
Configure netlify to send a webhook to the app when a deploy finishes/fails
We send all users who opt in to deploy notifications an email with the status
  Issues
    1. Accommodating an "additional emails" input on the deploy page is proving to
    add more complexity than it might be worth - we have no way to "safely" get the deploy that the user
    started off of the API, all we can use is position in the feed list, Netlify won't return
    the ID for the deploy which would really be ideal. We also have to build in a layer of trying
    to keep track of the deploy on our end so the additional emails can be attached to something.

    2. We'd have to add a model for tracking deploys fae_deploys
      environment
      deploy ID from netlify
      deploy status from netlify
      have we notified this deploy?

      A. User clicks deploy button
          create fae_deploy for environment
          get most recent deploy from api list
            update fae_deploy with ID

        a. On every list poll get status of most recent non-notified fae_deploy by ID match
            when it's status is 'ready'
              check if error_message present
                if not, notify success deploy, else notify failed deploy
  

CONTENT COMPONENT IMPROVEMENTS

1. FAE becomes GQL enabled by default.

2. Content Component system is built-in.

  1. Preview / Orientation Functionality
    A. Basic graphic representation of what the component is
      a. Image of basic component on FE.
      b. Preview functionality with FE refresh / iframe? (Avery?)

  2. Use FAE's modal setup instead of the typical nested form dropdown madness.
    A. Needs some CSS work, longer forms don't flex or scroll.
